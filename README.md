# Circle packing

I want to try packing as many unit balls into the smallest enclosing ball possible. I already have a rough idea of how to do it, but this project will help me get more familiar with python. I will try to do it using a method I saw online, and then also using built in python optimization routines. I would like to also generalize it to balls under different norms e.g. squares (1-norm), stars (0.5 norm), etc.
